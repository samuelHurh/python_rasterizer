# python_rasterizer
A program that applies DDA and Scanline algorithms to create raster images from text input.

In order to do so, you'll need to run the makefile in your terminal once pulling the code.
Type:
make run file="./rasterizer-files/filename.txt"
and choose one of those files to insert for "filename"
This can be used to generate one of the images provided (delete the image and run to verify).
